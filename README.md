I gave this talk at [FOSDEM 2015](https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/how_adblockers_work/).

### Abstract

There is an increase in popularity of adblockers. Adblock Plus is the oldest and
most popular one, with over 50M users. But most people still don't know how an
adblocker actually works. In this talk I will attempt to explain how adblocking
works, at least how we have implemented it in Adblock Plus.
